            <p>
                From late 1951 through 1952, the war was defined by a static, fortified front line. The conflict devolved into a series of vicious, small-scale battles for control of strategic high ground. These engagements, fought over desolate hills with names like <strong>Pork Chop Hill</strong>, <strong>Old Baldy</strong>, and <strong>Heartbreak Ridge</strong>, were incredibly costly. Soldiers endured brutal trench warfare conditions while fighting for objectives that offered little strategic value but were seen as vital for leverage in the ongoing peace talks.

                The armistice negotiations, which had moved to <strong>Panmunjom</strong>, remained deadlocked for most of this period. The single greatest obstacle was the issue of <strong>prisoners of war (POWs)</strong>. The UN command insisted on the principle of voluntary repatriation, allowing prisoners to choose whether they returned to their home country. This was a significant issue, as tens of thousands of North Korean and Chinese soldiers did not want to return to communist rule. The communists, however, demanded the forced repatriation of all prisoners, leading to a prolonged and bitter impasse.

                Several key events in 1953 finally broke the diplomatic stalemate. The election of <strong>President Dwight D. Eisenhower</strong>, who had promised to end the war, and the death of Soviet leader <strong>Joseph Stalin</strong> in March changed the political dynamics. With all sides exhausted by the conflict and facing immense pressure, concessions were made. The POW issue was finally resolved through a complex agreement involving a neutral repatriation commission.

                After two years of negotiation, the <strong>Korean Armistice Agreement was finally signed on July 27, 1953</strong>. The agreement ended the fighting and established the <strong>Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)</strong>, a 4-kilometer-wide buffer that runs across the peninsula near the 38th parallel. The armistice brought a ceasefire but was not a formal peace treaty. Technically, the Korean War has never officially ended, and the DMZ remains one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world.
