                The year 1951 began with UN forces in full retreat following China's entry into the war. The Chinese light infantry and deception attacks proved devastating, and Seoul was captured by communist forces for a second time in January. However, the UN lines eventually stabilized south of the capital, and under the new command of <strong>General Matthew Ridgway</strong>, they began a series of effective counter-offensives.

                Operations like <strong>Thunderbolt</strong> and <strong>Ripper</strong> utilized the UN's superior firepower to inflict massive casualties on the Chinese and North Korean forces. Seoul was recaptured by the UN for the final time in March. By June, the front lines had solidified roughly along the <strong>38th parallel</strong>, the original dividing line. The war of rapid movement was over, replaced by a brutal war of attrition, with both sides digging into fortified positions.

                A major political event occurred in April 1951 when <strong>President Harry S. Truman dismissed General Douglas MacArthur</strong>. MacArthur had publicly advocated for expanding the war into China, including a naval blockade and the bombing of Chinese cities, which Truman feared would escalate into a third World War. This clash between the general and the president highlighted the political complexities of fighting a "limited war" in the Cold War era.

                With the battlefield locked in a stalemate, both sides agreed to begin armistice negotiations. The first peace talks began in <strong>Kaesong in July 1951</strong>. Hopes for a quick resolution faded as the talks immediately bogged down over numerous issues, including the precise location of the ceasefire line. While diplomats argued, fierce fighting continued along the front as both sides battled for tactical advantages and control of strategic hills.
